# Approach Explanation: Adobe Hackathon Round 1A

## Overview
Our solution for heading extraction from PDF documents employs a hybrid approach combining rule-based heuristics with machine learning (LightGBM) classification. This approach ensures robust performance across diverse document types while maintaining the strict constraints of CPU-only execution, ≤200MB model size, and ≤10 seconds runtime.

## Technical Pipeline

### 1. Document Processing
The pipeline begins with PDF parsing using `pdfplumber`, extracting text elements with their associated metadata (font size, position, style). This provides the foundation for both heuristic and ML-based analysis. Text elements are normalized and filtered to remove noise while preserving structural information.

### 2. Feature Extraction
We extract 8 key features for each text element:
- **Font characteristics**: Size, bold/italic detection
- **Text properties**: Length, capitalization ratio
- **Layout features**: Vertical position, whitespace analysis
- **Pattern recognition**: Numbering patterns (1., 1.1, I., A., etc.)

These features capture both visual and semantic cues that distinguish headings from regular text.

### 3. Hybrid Classification Approach
Our system uses a two-tier classification strategy:

**Heuristic Rules**: Primary detection based on font size thresholds, position analysis, and pattern matching. This provides a reliable baseline that works across different document styles.

**Machine Learning Enhancement**: LightGBM classifier trained on manually labeled data refines the heuristic predictions. The model learns subtle patterns and improves accuracy on edge cases while maintaining interpretability.

### 4. Hierarchical Structure Building
Detected headings are organized into a hierarchical outline (H1, H2, H3) using:
- Font size relationships
- Indentation patterns
- Sequential numbering
- Position-based clustering

### 5. Multilingual Support
The system adapts to different languages through:
- Language detection using `langdetect` and `polyglot`
- Language-specific heading patterns
- Unicode-aware text processing
- Cultural formatting considerations

## Key Innovations

### Robust Feature Engineering
Our feature set balances simplicity with effectiveness, ensuring the model remains lightweight while capturing essential heading characteristics. The combination of visual and textual features provides redundancy against document variations.

### Fallback Mechanisms
The system gracefully degrades from ML-enhanced to heuristic-only mode when the model is unavailable, ensuring reliability in all deployment scenarios.

### Confidence Scoring
Each detected heading includes a confidence score based on feature strength and model probability, enabling downstream applications to filter results appropriately.

## Performance Optimization

### Runtime Efficiency
- Vectorized feature extraction using NumPy
- Efficient PDF parsing with minimal memory overhead
- Optimized LightGBM parameters for speed
- Early termination for simple documents

### Model Size Management
- Lightweight feature set (8 features)
- Compact LightGBM model configuration
- Minimal dependency footprint
- Efficient serialization

## Evaluation Framework

Our evaluation system provides comprehensive metrics:
- **Per-level analysis**: Precision, recall, F1 for each heading level
- **Hierarchical evaluation**: Considers parent-child relationships
- **Runtime monitoring**: Ensures ≤10s constraint compliance
- **Error analysis**: Detailed misclassification analysis for continuous improvement

## Deployment Strategy

The solution is containerized using Docker for consistent execution across environments. The CPU-only design eliminates GPU dependencies while maintaining performance. The modular architecture allows for easy integration into existing document processing pipelines.

This hybrid approach delivers robust heading extraction performance while meeting all hackathon constraints, providing a production-ready solution for document structure analysis.
